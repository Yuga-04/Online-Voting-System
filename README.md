## 📄 Project Description

This webpage is a **demo for a secured online voting system** aimed at increasing the voting percentage.

Often, voters are unable to cast their votes due to personal issues or being out of the country. This project proposes an **online voting solution** to tackle these problems and improve participation in the electoral process.

This webpage showcases the **demo and idea implementation** for such a system.
